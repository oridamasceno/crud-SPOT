# Player Management API

If I were a beginner trainee on the great coach Ted Lasso's team, this is how I would develop our first registration and skill mapping of our players. (and like the rest of the team, I have a lot to learn)

</p>

## What did I do? ðŸ—¹
I carried out all the required requests and the bonuses ones, and for this I used the following technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and finally Swagger for API Documentation. You should find important comments within the code, I like to keep them there and I see it as good practice, I hope you like it!

## You may need

Before running the project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually already included with Node.js)
- A MongoDB database (local or a hosting service like MongoDB Atlas)

## How to use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oridamasceno/crud-SPOT.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd crud-SPOT
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Edit the .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string. For example:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/databaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

5. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints
